<h1>Recipe Manager</h1>
Create a user account at /signup, or log in with Google at /login. Then browse recipes and create/edit your own recipe. Recipes include a recipe name, ingredients, and optional categories (e.g. Vegetarian, Dessert, Potluck). A user can browse all recipes from all users and view/edit their own recipes. Only a recipe's creator can edit the recipe, and only logged-in users can view the details of other user's recipes.

You can also sort users by the users with the most recipes ("Most Prolific"). /users/most_recipes

When browsing categories, you can sort by name or most popular. /categories
Users can also view the number of recipes for each category, and view all recipes that fall under that category. /recipes

For ingredients, users can see how many recipes use that ingredient from the index page. Click the ingredient to see all recipes that contain the ingredient. /ingredients
